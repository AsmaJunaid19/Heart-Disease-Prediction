# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques on the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains patients' medical history and test results. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis involved visualizing feature distributions and analyzing correlations. Outliers were detected and removed using box plots and the Interquartile Range method. A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. The model achieved an accuracy of 74.26%, with varying performance across classes. While it performed well for some classes, it struggled with others, particularly class 4, which had a precision and recall of 0.00. Further improvements could be made by exploring different models, feature engineering techniques, or handling class imbalance. The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease, which is a significant global cause of mortality.
